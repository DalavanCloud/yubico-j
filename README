#summary Introduction and installation of the Yubico Java library

= Introduction =

This package make up the low-level Java software development kit for
the Yubico authentication device, the Yubikey.  In particular:

  * COPYING: software license

  * build.properties, build.xml: build files for 'ant'.

  * resources/: libraries needed by this package, see resources/README

  * src/: source code of Yubikey package.

  * test/: self-tests

== Building ==

Build the package by invoking:

{{{
  $ ant
}}}

The output Java library will be stored in out/base.jar.

== Test the code ==

To decode a Yubikey OTP you need the AES key for the yubikey.  Contact
Yubico to get it.  Then you can invoke the tool as follows:

{{{
  $ cd classes
  $ java com.yubico.base.tools.Display <aeskey> <one_time_password>
}}}

Replace <aeskey> with the modhex encoded AES key and
<one_time_password> with the Yubikey output.

== Self-tests ==

Run the self-tests to make sure it is working properly:

{{{
  $ ant test
}}}

== Questions? ==
